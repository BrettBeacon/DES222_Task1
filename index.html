                What is it that makes you who you are, is it your body, your mind, is it how you think or what you
                think, is it where you were born, or where you live? There are questions that we don’t have the answers
                to now, like, if I was to move my brain from my body into another body, would I still be me? Does my
                body even matter when I think about who I am? It is believed that the things that make you, you are your
                memories, the things that happened to you during your life, the environment you grew up in and the way
                you grew up, all these things give unique memories that help to shape your point of view, your life and
                who you are, who you are is your brain and the electric signals that fire off within it. What makes me,
                me, are the memories I have from growing up, the experiences I went through and live every day that
                shaped my point of view and my memories into what I am today. I think regardless of whether I was to
                move from this body to another body or a robot body, I would still have my memories of the body I use to
                possess and I would eventually become accustomed to my new body.

                It is said that our identity is fairly fluid throughout our younger years of life, we are still finding
                who we are, who we want to be and what we think is who we are to others, they say this happens for quiet
                some time, but eventually, we accept the identity we have been moulding all that time and start to live
                the life of the identity we have found. I think this is true in a lot of ways, however, I also think
                change happens slowly enough that we don’t see it, but I think everyone changes and has the capacity to
                change who they are and what they think, to the point of being someone completely different from what
                they may even recognise themselves.
                Humans are capable of great change because we can adapt to our environment, and this is true of our
                identity and what we think and what shaped who we are.

                We are obsessed with identity, with wanting something different, of adventure and fantasy. We write
                about worlds that are very different to our own to escape the reality of our own life, we play computer
                games to live a different life, a life of fantasy, of identity, taking on the life of a character in a
                game, but not just playing the character, but living the life, making decisions based on the characters
                identity, the background story of that character and giving life to something that isn’t real. I think
                we have all wanted to escape into a fantasy, regardless of the story and what is going on within it, we
                have all wanted to be someone else other than who we are. We are fascinated with being someone else,
                pretending to be in a fantasy. We do this from a small age, playing make believe, pretending to be
                someone who we are not, to live a fantasy life, we tend to do this for entertainment, but as you get
                older, I feel it is more to do with escape.
